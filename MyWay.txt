Title: My Way

Verse 1:
And now.... the end is near
and it looks like a bit of curtain
my friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life thats full
I've travelled each and every highway
dum dum dum
I did it my way

Bridge:
yes there were times,
I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could eat
